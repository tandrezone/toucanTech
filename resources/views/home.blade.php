    <h1>The Test</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The ToucanTech database stores information about its members. Each member can be associated with 1 or more school.</li>
        <li>Please should build a demo that allows someone to add a new member with the fields “Name”, “Email Address” and "School" (selected from a list). The demo should display all members for a selected school.</li>
        <li>The primary language we use is PHP and we use an MVC framework so please use this in your coding test.</li>
        <li>We will want to run and connect to your code on our own machines so if there are any unusual pre-requisites please document them.</li>
        <li>Please treat this as a serious piece of code and apply best practices. This code is being written for others to scrutinise - if you are selected for interview you will be asked about it.</li>
        <li>We will be assessing your program and database design. Code re-use, extensibility and maintenance are all important.</li>
    </ul>
